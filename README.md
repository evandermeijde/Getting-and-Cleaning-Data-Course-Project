    3. Load the activity and feature info
    4. Loads both the training and test datasets
    5. Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
    6. Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
    7. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average value of each variable for each subject and activity pair

The end result is shown in the file dataMean.txt
